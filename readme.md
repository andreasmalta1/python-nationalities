### Top 5 Leagues & Uefa Competitions Nationalities:

This utility generates nationality statistics for the top 5 leagues in Europe and the main UEFA competetions. For each league (English Premier League, Spanish La Liga, Italian Serie A, French Ligue 1, German Bundesliga) as well as the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League, a chart will be generated showing the Top 10 nationalities represented in terms of number of players, minutes played and goals scored for the current season. A chart for the combined is also genereated. All charts are saved as png image files.

To run the project, install the requirements.txt and then run the nationalities.py file.
